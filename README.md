First PYE's signature homework, using Python I explore a dataset and analize it. In this notebook develop some useful functions to calculate central tendency's measures and scattering measures.

## Functions explained:
Explained of functions used in the notebook to get central measures by qualitative var and to get frequency table in easy way.

### Get central measures
Function that returns a dataframe with these measures based on a qualitative variable.
